# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

I developed this project as part of Udacity's training program when I started my Journey in this field.

Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I have used Python and OpenCV to detect lane lines.  OpenCV is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

There are two files that will help to know more: 
First is [code](https://github.com/harinjoshi/FindingLaneLines/blob/master/P1.ipynb) and 
the second is  [writeup](https://github.com/harinjoshi/FindingLaneLines/blob/master/writeup_template.md).

The code file is called P1.ipynb and the writeup template is writeup_template.md
